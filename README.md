## **levelup**

**Collateralized Social Lending on Stellar**

levelup is an open-source DeFi protocol that enables **community-powered lending without liquidity pools**, using **savings, insurance, and on-chain reputation** as collateral.

levelup focuses on what blockchains do best: **value custody, trust minimization, and programmable enforcement**, while keeping social coordination and UX-heavy logic off-chain for scalability.

Our goal is to unlock **fair, accessible credit in emerging markets** by transforming everyday savings into a trustless lending primitive.

## **Why levelup?**

Today’s credit systems suffer from:

- Capital-inefficient DeFi liquidity pools
- Exclusion due to lack of credit history
- Fragile trust in informal savings groups
- High borrowing costs and over-collateralization

levelup solves this by allowing communities to **lend to themselves**, backed by protocol-level insurance and verifiable reputation.

---

## **Why Stellar?**

levelup is designed **for Stellar**, not just deployed on it.

Stellar enables:

- Fast settlement (seconds)
- Ultra-low transaction fees
- Multi-asset support (USDC, fiat anchors, local tokens)
- Multi-sig & conditional transactions
- Built-in primitives for escrow-like flows

This makes Stellar ideal for:

- Rotational savings groups
- Upfront payouts backed by locked savings
- Insurance-backed default protection
- Cross-border community finance

## **Core Concepts**

### **1. Lock-to-Borrow Savings**

Members lock part of their target payout to qualify for early access.
Savings act as **collateral + commitment**.

---

### **2. Insurance-Backed Groups**

A portion of every contribution flows into an insurance pool.
Defaults are covered automatically.
Unused insurance is redistributed to members.

---

### **3. Reputation as Credit**

Repayment history is recorded on-chain.
Higher reputation unlocks:

- Earlier payouts
- Lower lock requirements
- Access to premium groups
